This project is part of a game development course of I taught for York College's STEP Program starting on March 1st 2024.

The game was implemented in the Godot Engine (version 4.3). It is a rudamintary 2D platformer with using low resolution sprites.

This game is incomplete and has been discontinued, as the course ended on May 3rd 2024.
All visual assets within this repo are drawn and animated by me, they're free for anyone.
